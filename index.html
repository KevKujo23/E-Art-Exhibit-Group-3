            The Edo period that lasted between 1603 and 1867 was the era of immeasurable peace and cultural development in Japan. The Tokugawa Shogunate introduced a policy of isolation, called sakoku, which caused the country to be less influenced by other countries and enabled Japan to form its own distinct culture. This stability led to the expansion of Edo (present day Tokyo) into one of the largest cities in the world, in which a new elite of merchants started to form and threaten the traditional influence of the samurai. As the economy flourished so did the arts, as new forms of artistic expression were created, to meet the preferences of the urban merchant classes. This period was characterized by the ukiyo-e which featured an illustration of the lively urban life, and the erection of classic architecture such as the Katsura Imperial Villa which represented minimalism yet with a touch of sophistication that was in touch with nature.

            The emergence of the merchant class in the Edo period also caused the change in the focus of the artistic production. The prints of ukiyo-e, the actors, beautiful women, and landscapes became very popular and provided a glimpse into the culture of the pleasure seekers of the urban areas of Edo. The Nikko Tosho-gu Shrine and Katsura Imperial Villa are examples of buildings that in the field of architecture portrayed the focus of the time on natural beauty and the simplicity and sophistication of designs. The principles of harmony and balance, which were inspired by Zen, were emphasized through the use of space, light, and natural materials in the architecture. These cultural trends in art and architecture combined to make the Edo period a period of rich and indigenous creativity, with the beauty of nature and energy of the city existing side by side in a distinctly Japanese manner.
