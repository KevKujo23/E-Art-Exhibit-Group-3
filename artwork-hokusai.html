            <h2>Describe</h2>
            <p>
              This ukiyo-e print shows a towering, curling wave dominating the foreground, its foam shaped
              like clawed fingers about to crash down on three fragile boats. Mount Fuji appears in the
              distant background, small and calm compared to the violence of the water. The palette is
              dominated by deep Prussian blue, with pale beige boats and a muted sky. The composition is
              highly dynamic, with diagonal forces that pull the viewer’s eye across the scene. The human
              figures are tiny and almost swallowed by the sea, emphasizing the scale of nature.

            <h2>Interpret</h2>
            <p>
              The artwork can be interpreted as a visualization of the power and unpredictability of nature
              during the Edo period. While Mount Fuji stands as a symbol of permanence and spiritual stability,
              the wave suggests the instability of everyday life. The tiny fishermen reflect the vulnerability
              of common people, whose lives depend on forces beyond their control. The imported Prussian blue
              pigment also hints at Japan’s slowly shifting relationship with the outside world. Overall, the
              print can be read as both a celebration of nature’s energy and a reminder of human fragility.

            <h2>Evaluate</h2>
            <p>
              This work is highly effective in balancing beauty and tension. The stylized curves of the wave and
              the refined line work create a sense of elegance, even as the subject itself is violent. The decision
              to make Mount Fuji small but centered keeps the composition stable despite the chaos in the
              foreground. The limited color scheme makes the image cohesive and iconic. As an Edo-period image,
              it successfully captures a moment of everyday labor while elevating it into a dramatic, almost
              mythical scene.
